## Examples

1. Design a Parking lot system
2. Design an Elevator system
3. Design a Traffic Control System

## What you need to understand when given such a question

1. First thing the interviewer looks for is Requirement collection expertise - whether you can list out all possible reqs and whether you can scope the problem
2. The interviewer is looking for your design skills, especially object-oriented. Can you design whole system in terms of components and classes? How will you model the system into diff classes, identify constraints and design interfaces
   More OOP concepts like abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, defining links and associations between classes or objects
3. Discuss the design in terms of Design patterns
4. Can you identify different object-oriented design patterns or programming patterns while designing the system.
5. Sometimes interviewer may present situations to evaluate how you can tackle concurrency in your design, e.g in parking lot question - what is parking lot has two or more entrances or exits
6. Look out for requirements that demand an optimal design for the solution
7. This type of question is not a Distributed System design question unless you have clearly discussed this with the interviewer in the requirement collection phase.Do NOT complicate
