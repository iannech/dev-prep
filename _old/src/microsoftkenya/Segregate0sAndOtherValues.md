### Given an array, you need to move all 0's to the left and maintain the order of non-zeros. Can you do it in constant space and  one loop?

Example  
Input:  arr = {1,0,0,0,2,0,4,,3}  
Output: arr = {0,0,0,0,1,2,4,3}

Approach




````
for(int i=0; i<n-1; i++){
    for(int j=1; j<n; j++) {
            
        
    }
}
