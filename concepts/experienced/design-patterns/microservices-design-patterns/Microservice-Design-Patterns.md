# Microservice Design Patterns
These are software design patterns that generate reusable autonomous services. 

The Microservice architecture has several drawbacks and there are numerous issues that must be addressed, hence the design patterns.

## Understanding Microservices Design Patterns
To understand the use of design patterns in Microservices, we first need to understand the underlying principles of Microservices design Architecture i.e:
- **Autonomy** - Each service operates autonomously, eliminating the problems caused by interdependency. This allows greater deployment flexibility.
- **Scalability** - Services can scale up or down instantly in response to demand, optimizing resource allocation and cost.
- **Resilience** - If one service goes down, it doesn't affect other services. The service can also recover from failures more rapidly.
- **Decentralization** - Development teams can work independently, accelerating time-to-market and improving productivity.
- **Load balancing** - The architecure can distribute incoming traffic evenly across servers, preventing overloads and improving performance.
- **DevOps Integration** - DevOps is often integration into the architecture to ensure rapid delivery of high-quality services.
- **Continuous monitoring** - Real-time monitoring tools ensure highest level of performance, security and availability.
- **Fault Tolerance** - The system continues to function even if one or more services fail, ensuring a consistent user experience.
