# Integration Patterns

## API Gateway

- The API gateway design pattern can be considered a proxy services. It grants a single entry point for all Microservices and routes a request to the correct service or services.
- By using an API gateway, microservices can communicate with each other via a stateless server eg using HTTP requests or a message bus.
- The pattern also insulates the clients from needing to know how services are partitioned.
- Security such as Authentication and Authorization can be done at the API gateway layer for the entire service ecosystem.
- SSL Termination and Caching can also be achieved at this layer.

## Backend for Frontends (BFF)

- This is a variant of the API Gateway pattern that provides an extra layer between client applications and microservices.
- Unlike API Gateway, BFF isn't a single point of entry. Instead, it introduces a separate gateway for each client.
- Example: A company might have a Web app, a Mobile app and a third-party app. With BFF pattern, an API can be added for each app instead of a single bloated API being used for all 3. This not only improves user experience but also enhances system performance as each app can call the backend in parallel.
- This pattern can also be used to accommodate the functions of particularly complex apps or create separate gateways for different business domains.

## Aggregator Design Pattern

- This design pattern is used to collect pieces of data from various Microservices and returns and aggregate for processing.
- Although similar to BFF, an Aggregator is more generic and not explicitly used for UI.
- To complete tasks, an Aggregator pattern receives a request and sends out requests to multiple services, based on the tasks it was assigned. Once every service has answered the requests, it combines the results and initiates a response to the original request.

## Proxy Design Pattern

- This design pattern is is a variation of the aggregator pattern where we can create a Microservice to invoke other services based on business requirements. For example consider a company that has a monolith application and it needs to move to Microservices architecture. So, when deploying the microservices, we need to ensure we don't break the client integration if say, they were calling the monolith differently we might need to introduce a Proxy service that determines how we call the backend services.

- So, in this way, you can independently deploy the service without affecting the consumer. When thereâ€™s no traffic, and schema 1 does not receive requests from the consumers, you can decommission service 1 and keep service 2 (new version). Here, semantic versioning is much important.
- Important things to consider when using a Proxy pattern:

  - Versioning
  - Service Discovery
  - Handling timeouts
